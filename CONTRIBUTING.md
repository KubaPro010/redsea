# Contributing guidelines

## Creating an issue

Bug reports are very useful for the development of redsea.

* When creating a new bug report ("issue"), be sure to include basic
  information about your system:
  ** Operating system version
  ** CPU architecture
  ** Did you compile the libraries (liquid-dsp, sndfile) yourself or are they
   from package repositories?
* If there is an error message, please include the error message in the bug
  report.
* Be sure to check back with GitHub afterwards to see if I've asked any
  clarifying questions. I may not have access to an environment similar to
  yours and can't necessarily reproduce the bug myself.
* If you fixed the problem yourself, it would be helpful to hear your
  solution! It's possible that others will also run into similar problems.
