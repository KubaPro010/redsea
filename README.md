# redsea RDS decoder

redsea is a free, fast, and lightweight command-line
[RDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Data_System) decoder for Linux/macOS,
written by Oona R채is채nen. It can be used with any
[RTL-SDR](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/) USB radio stick with the
`rtl_fm` tool. It can also decode raw ASCII bitstream, the hex format used by
RDS Spy, and audio files containing multiplex signals (MPX).

Decoded RDS groups are printed to the terminal as line-delimited JSON objects
or, optionally, undecoded hex blocks (`-x`).

## Installation

You will need git, the [liquid-dsp](https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp)
library, and GNU autotools. Audio files can be decoded if libsndfile is
installed. On macOS (OSX) you will also need XCode command-line tools
(`xcode-select --install`).

1. Clone the repository (unless you downloaded a release zip file):

        $ git clone https://github.com/windytan/redsea.git
        $ cd redsea

2. Compile redsea:

        $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

3. Install:

        $ make install

It is also simple to later pull the latest updates and recompile:

        $ git pull
        $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make clean && make
        $ make install

For a slower machine it can take some time to compile the TMC support. This can
be disabled (`./configure --disable-tmc`).

If you only need to decode hex or binary input and don't need demodulation,
you can compile redsea without liquid-dsp (`./configure --without-liquid`).

## Usage

### Live decoding with rtl_fm

The full command is:

    $ rtl_fm -M fm -l 0 -A std -p 0 -s 171k -g 40 -F 9 -f 87.9M | redsea

There's a shorthand shell script called `rtl-rx.sh`:

    $ ./rtl-rx.sh -f 87.9M

Command line options to this script are passed on to `rtl_fm`. (These are not
options for redsea.) Station frequency,
`-f`, is mandatory. It may also be helpful to set the ppm error in the
crystal using `-p`. Gain is set to 40 dB by default. The script can be modified
to include additional parameters to redsea as well.

For Raspberry Pi 1 it's necessary to change `-A std` to `-A fast`. This
way more more CPU cycles will be left to redsea.

Note that `rtl_fm` will tune a bit off; this is normal and is done to
avoid the DC spike.

### Decoding MPX from a file or via sound card

It's easy to decode audio files containing a demodulated FM carrier. Note that
the file must have around 128k samples per second or more; 171k will work
fastest.

    $ redsea -f multiplex.wav

If your sound card supports recording at high sample rates (e.g. 192 kHz) you
can also decode the MPX output of an FM tuner or RDS encoder, for instance
with this `sox` command:

    $ rec -t .s16 -r 171k -c 1 - | redsea

By default, the raw MPX input is assumed to be 16-bit signed-integer
single-channel samples at 171 kHz.

### Full usage

```
radio_command | redsea [OPTIONS]

-b, --input-bits       Input is ASCII bit stream (011010110...)

-e, --feed-through     Echo the input signal to stdout and print
                       decoded groups to stderr

-E, --bler             Display average block error rate (percentage of blocks
                       that had errors)

-f, --file FILENAME    Use an audio file as input

-h, --input-hex        Input is hex groups in the RDS Spy format

-l, --loctable DIR     Load TMC location table from a directory in TMC
                       Exchange format

-p, --show-partial     Display PS and RadioText before completely
                       received (as partial_ps, partial_radiotext)

-r, --samplerate RATE  Set input sample frequency - will resample
                       (slow) if this differs from 171000 Hz

-t, --timestamp FORMAT Add time of decoding to JSON groups, see
                       man strftime for formatting options (or
                       try "%c")

-u, --rbds             Use RBDS (North American) program types

-v, --version          Print version

-x, --output-hex       Output is hex groups in the RDS Spy format
```

## Tips for output formatting

The JSON output can be tidied and/or colored using `jq`:

    $ ./rtl-rx.sh -f 87.9M | jq

It can also be used to extract only certain fields, for instance the program
type:

    $ ./rtl-rx.sh -f 87.9M | jq '.prog_type'

## Requirements

* Linux or macOS
* C++11 compiler
* GNU autotools
* libiconv
* libsndfile (optional)
* [liquid-dsp](https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp)
* `rtl_fm` (from [rtl-sdr](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr)) or any
   other source that can output demodulated FM multiplex signals

## Features

Redsea decodes the following basic info from RDS:

* Program Identification code (PI)
* Program Service name (PS)
* RadioText (RT)
* Traffic Program (TP) and Traffic Announcement (TA) flags
* Music/Speech (M/S) flag
* Program Type (PTY)
* Alternative Frequencies (AF)
* Clock Time and Date (CT)
* Program Item Number (PIN)
* Decoder Identification (DI)
* Enhanced Other Networks (EON) information

And also these Open Data Applications:

* RadioText Plus (RT+)
* Traffic Message Channel (RDS-TMC)

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find liquid-dsp on macOS

If you've installed [liquid-dsp](https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp) yet
`configure` can't find it, it's possible that XCode command line tools aren't
installed. Run this command to fix it:

    xcode-select --install

## Contributing

[Bug reports](https://github.com/windytan/redsea/issues) are welcome. Also, if a
station in your area is transmitting an interesting Open Data application that
should be implemented in redsea, I would be happy to see a minute or two's worth
of hex data using the `-x` switch.
